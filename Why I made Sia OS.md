Sia OS is a small project I started to work on when my school shutdown due to the Pandemic. It's named after one of my cats who recently ran away from home and never came back (R.I.P Sia). I always wanted to make an OS and when I found out about Cosmos, I was happy. I tried making an OS before from a Tutorial called Write "Your Own Operating System (WYOOS)" taught by TheAlgorithMan. That version of the OS never went far. When I started working on Sia OS it started simple. I made some simple commands like an echo command and shut off. I soon learned how to do more and my OS grew. The way I wrote it was like if it was a simple C# Console program because I didn't know how to use Cosmos. I was able to make a (Basic) Directory system and a GUI with a some-what working clock, all using mostly if statements and other simple stuff. All of this fits into one file, the only other being the mouse.
