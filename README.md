# Sia-OS
A Command-Line Operating System created in C# using Cosmos OS

HOW TO RUN SIA OS:

1. Download Sia OS iso

2. Download a Virtual Machine (Known to work on VMware and should work on Hyper-V (FILE SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK ON VIRTUAL BOX) )

3. Download Pre-Formated Hard drives for Appropriate Virtual Machine and set up the VM using the harddrive (There is no Partitioning tools so the drive must be pre-partitioned with FAT32 in order to work.)(if you preformat it you will have to set the bios to boot from CD first)

Note: The FS does not work on Real hardware. It will just be very broken and you can't do anything on it with out it bugging out.
