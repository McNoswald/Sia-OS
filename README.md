# Sia-OS

|SIA OS 1.1 PRE-RELEASE IS HERE. YOU CAN NOW TEST IT FOR YOUR SELF|

A Command-Line Operating System created in C# using CosmosOS
_______________________________________
FEATURES (of V1.0):

  -File System (Buggy)

  -Power Commands

  -W.I.P GUI (VMware only)

  -Extremely simple file creator

  -Simple Programs (Time, Calc, Calender, Piano)
_______________________________________
HOW TO RUN SIA OS:

1. Download Sia OS iso

2. Download a Virtual Machine (Known to work on VMware and should work on Hyper-V (FILE SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK ON VIRTUAL BOX) )

3. Download Pre-Formated Hard drives for Appropriate Virtual Machine and set up the VM using the harddrive (There are no Partitioning tools so the harddrive must be pre-partitioned with FAT32 to work. Recommended to use GParted. if you preformat it you, will have to set the bios to boot from CD first)

Note: The FS does not work on Real hardware. It will just be very broken, and you can't do anything on it without it bugging out.
