How to use some of the commands:

CD - Uses: CD FULLPATH  CD DIR (CD .. does not exist yet. I'm currently trying to find out how to make it work)
COPY - How this works is you must type COPY FILE.EXT and only that. It will ask for the directory after you press enter. You must input the full Path of where you want to copy
MKCAL - Only type the command, it will ask for the date of the calender (must be in MM-DD-YY format). It will use that as the file name. Then you must type out every event for every hour.
CHKCAL - Only type the command, it will after ask what day to check for and will tell you if there is one.
TEXT - Only type the command, it will after ask for the file name and extension.
